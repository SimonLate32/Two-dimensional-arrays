We will call "friendly" elements for a two-dimensional array
such elements that connect to a given element on one side
and have the same value, as well as all friendly elements for 
the friendly elements of this element. Create a new array for the transmitted
two-dimensional array, in which each element will
contain information about the number of friendly elements for
the corresponding element in the transmitted array.
